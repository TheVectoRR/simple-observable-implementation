# simple-observable-implementation

This simple repo helps to demonstrate how observables and operators work under the hood of RXJava2.

## It demonstartes that:

- A chain of Observable operators do not operate independently on the original Observable that originates the chain, but they operate in turn, each one operating on the Observable generated by the operator immediately previous in the chain.

- Observables will react to new subscribers, will start emitting opun subscribing to them. in other word, I am dealing only with cold observables here.

- How does onNext(), OnError() and onComplete() works.

- How does unsubscribing (now called Disposables) works and how does it dispose of resources each observable might use.
